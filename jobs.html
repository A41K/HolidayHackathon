            <p class="j1">Our beliefs about work environments are pretty simple - give talented and experienced people the tools they need, the colleagues who will stimulate them, and the opportunity to build games they want to play. The hard part is finding the right people who have the professionalism, maturity, and talent to deliver in that kind of environment.</p>
            <p class="j2">We've had to go pretty far afield in our search, and even after aggressive screening have averaged about 5 on-site interviews for each person we've hired.</p>
