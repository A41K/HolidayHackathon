        <p class="project1">Our first project, Half-Life, shows off Valve's proprietary technology, including 16-bit color, colored lighting and amazing advances in character movement – all without the benefit of hardware accelerators. Half-Life also incorporates technology licensed from id Software.</p>
        <p class="project2">Sierra On-Line is the exclusive publisher and distributor of Half-Life, which will be available mid-March, 1998.</p>

        <p class="excerptwhat">excerpt from the official press release:</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Half-Life introduces a revolutionary leap in the 3D first-person gaming genre by combining stunning technology enhancements with genre-breaking gameplay elements. Gamers are given opportunities to wreak havoc--in true action-game fashion--but they are also challenged to explore and strategize; for instance, telling friend from foe is no longer a simple matter of humans vs. monsters. Half-life's strong story elements, advanced inventory system and story-integrated challenges create an experience never-before-seen in traditional "run-and-gun" action games.</p>
